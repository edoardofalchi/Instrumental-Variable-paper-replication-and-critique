# N. Nunn (Harvard University) - paper replication & critique :earth_africa: :ship: | Edoardo Falchi

This project implements Instrumental Variable technique, and is about replicating the main findings (plots and tables) from the paper

> Nunn N. The Long Term Effects of Africa's Slave Trades. Quarterly Journal of Economics. 2008; 123 (1) : 139-176

His research question is:
> Can part of Africa’s current underdevelopment be explained by its slave trades? To explore this question, I use data from shipping records and historical documents reporting slave ethnicities to construct estimates of the number of slaves exported from each country during Africa’s slave trades. I find a robust negative relationship between the number of slaves exported from a country and current economic performance. To better understand if the relationship is causal, I examine the historical evidence on selection into the slave trades and use **instrumental variables**. Together the evidence suggests that the slave trades had an adverse effect on economic development.

What this project does not include is questioning the author's aurgumentations. For a detailed evidence examination please refer to the author's paper which he made freely available on his [Harvard webiste](https://scholar.harvard.edu/nunn/publications/long-term-effects-africas-slave-trades) along with the [dataset](https://scholar.harvard.edu/nunn/pages/data-0).  

However, in the Critique section, I point out some flaws which I think weaken Nunn's results and some improvements which I personally suggest are woth considering, namely:
* weak instrument
* use of Heteroskedasticity-Consistent standard errors
